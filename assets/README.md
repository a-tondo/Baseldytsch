## About the Basilisk

The Basel coat of arms features the Baselstab (Basel staff), a crozier with a curled top. This symbol dates back to the 14th century and represents Basel's status as a bishop's see. The black basilisk (a legendary creature) on the white background is one of Switzerland's most recognizable heraldic symbols.
